Hey there!

I've been tinkering with Minecraft modding and came up with something I call "Hoplite Overhead." It's a mod that shows player stats (currently only health and player's kills during the game), above their heads during Battle Royale games. I originally made it for myself, but thought others might find it handy too, so I'm sharing it here.

**Important Note:** I'm pretty new to this whole Minecraft modding scene. This mod works for me, but it might not be perfect and could have some performance issues.
**MORE IMPORTANT NOTE**: This mod is use at your own risk, it is stated at Hoplite's rules page that a mod like this IS NOT ALLOWED.
> Any modification giving you extra information on an enemy playerâ€™s location, items or **health** are prohibited.

You can build it yourself if you know what you're doing, otherwise you can find a prebuilt version [here](https://github.com/hedafr/Hoplite-Overhead/releases).

**Feedback and Contributions:**
If you have suggestions, encounter bugs, or want to help improve the mod, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm learning as I go, and your input would be super helpful!

Thanks for checking out Hoplite Overhead. Your support means a lot and keeps me motivated to keep improving!
